# Fun-With-JFrame
This program can do three things using the JFrame (which turns out to be way better than the CS2114 Window class!).
To change what the program does, change the value of the task Enum variable in the JFrameWindow constructor. The
possible task values, as well as what they do when the program uses each value, are described below:
-GENERATE_RANDOM_LINES simply draws lines of random position and length across the JFrame
-CREATE_NESTED_SQUARES_FRACTAL creates a fractal consisting of squares nested inside one another, 
colored with a cool-looking red/gray color scheme
-CREATE_TREE_FRACTAL uses recursion to create an awesome-looking self-similar tree fractal. The line thickness gets
thinner as the branches get smaller to create a more realistic appearance
